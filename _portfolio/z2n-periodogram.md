## About The Project

The Z2n Software was developed by Yohan Alexander as a research project, funded by the CNPq Institution, and it is a Open Source initiative. The program allows the user to calculate periodograms using the Z2n statistics a la Buccheri et al. 1983, which is defined as follows.

![\Large \phi_j \[0,1\] = frac(v_i\Delta t_{ij} + \dot v_i \frac{\Delta t^2_{ij}}{2} + \dot v_i \frac{\Delta t^3_{ij}}{6})](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CLarge%20%5Cphi_j%20%5B0%2C1%5D%20%3D%20frac(v_i%5CDelta%20t_%7Bij%7D%20%2B%20%5Cdot%20v_i%20%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%20t%5E2_%7Bij%7D%7D%7B2%7D%20%2B%20%5Cdot%20v_i%20%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%20t%5E3_%7Bij%7D%7D%7B6%7D))

![\Large Z^2_n = \frac{2}{N} \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{n} \[(\sum_{j=1}^{N} cos(k\phi_j)) ^ 2 + (\sum_{j=1}^{N} sin(k\phi_j)) ^ 2\]](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CLarge%20Z%5E2_n%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7BN%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Csum_%7Bk%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20%5B(%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5E%7BN%7D%20cos(k%5Cphi_j))%20%5E%202%20%2B%20(%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5E%7BN%7D%20sin(k%5Cphi_j))%20%5E%202%5D)

The standard Z2n statistics calculates the phase of each photon and the sinusoidal functions above for each photon. Be advised that this is very computationally expensive if the number of photons is high, since the algorithm grows at a exponential rate ![\large O(n^2)](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Clarge%20O(n%5E2)).


### Built With
The Z2n Software was built using the `Python` open source language.
* [Python](https://python.org)


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The version of the `Python` interpreter used during the development was the`3.7`, which can be managed in virtual environments such as `Anaconda`. Therefore, try to use the same or above versions for the best compatibility.

* Python>=3.7
* PIP

### Installation

The software is currently hosted at the Python central repository `PyPI`,  to install the software properly use the terminal command:
```sh
pip install z2n-periodogram
```

## Usage

To start the software just type `z2n` on the terminal (check if you're under the virtual environment that it is installed).
```sh
z2n
```

The `CLI` of the software is very interactive and it works by triggering the commands available, for more information on the usage type `help`.

```sh
        Z2n Software, a program for interactive periodograms analysis.

        Type "help" for more information or "docs" for documentation.

(z2n) >>> help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
docs  gauss  plot  run  save

Undocumented commands:
======================
exit  help  quit

(z2n) >>>
```

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://z2n-periodogram.readthedocs.io/)_
