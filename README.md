<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About me

• I am a self-taught data science student, currently majoring in Computer Science at the Federal University of Sergipe.
  
• In academic life, I do research at the level of Scientific Initiation in the High Energy Astrophysics Research Group, ASTRalE, in the Physics Department of the Federal University of Sergipe. Founded in 2018, the group has its activities based on space technology and astronomical observations conducted by satellites from American, European and Japanese space agencies.
  
• Passionate about the Python ecosystem, open-source and astronomical data, I dedicate my time to the study of methods to analyze and extract information from data via computational tools, such as machine learning and deep learning.
